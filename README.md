# Welcome to Sorobounties!üåø

Between November 15th and December 15th at 7 p.m. Eastern, you can receive awards for building decentralized applications (dapps) with Soroban on the Stellar network‚Äôs Testnet (Stellar Testnet), accompanied by explanatory content (such as written tutorials, video walkthroughs, etc.). This program is part of the Stellar Development Foundation‚Äôs $100M Soroban adoption fund and is similar to the previous [Sorobounty Spectacular](https://github.com/stellar/sorobounty-spectacular). 

The goal of this program is to provide the structure for application developers to build with Soroban and provide the educational materials for other devs to get up and running quickly on the platform as we approach Mainnet launch. We‚Äôre looking for any type of dapp ‚Äî from basic cryptographic games to NFT projects.

For each qualified submission you create, you can may be eligible to receive an award of between $400 and $1,300 worth of XLM. 

## Need some inspiration?

You can create:

- Practical dapps (such as this [Bitcoin price oracle](https://github.com/stellar/sorobounty-spectacular/discussions/29)) 
- Fun dapp tutorials (such as [Cowchain Farm](https://github.com/stellar/sorobounty-spectacular/discussions/14))
- Video walkthroughs (such as this one on [regulated assets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJo7htkGqBrFIHg6keCRRYjf6AEB1m1wo))

Soroban is currently live on Stellar Testnet. You may encounter some problems as you are using the platform and various tools. We encourage you to report any problems or bugs you find in our Stellar Developer Discord under the #soroban channels.

## What makes a good submission

The Stellar Development Foundation (‚ÄúSDF‚Äù) will review submissions as they come in, and all Sorobounties awards are contingent upon review and approval of the submission by SDF, in its sole discretion.

Your submission should be coherent and easy to follow. If you are creating a tutorial, the audience needs to be able to follow along. If you are writing code, what it does should be clear. All content and contract code also need to be public (GitHub, dev.to, Medium, or YouTube).

Awards will be based on the scope, complexity, and quality of the submission. That said, here is a rough idea of what certain types of submissions can receive.
If your submission is just dapp code and a demo, you are eligible to receive up to $400 worth of XLM. The award amount increases to up to $1,300 worth of XLM based on the accompanying content: from decent READMEs to published written tutorials on dev.to to video tutorials on YouTube. The more you include in your submission, the better!

**Note:** SDF is under no obligation to make any awards if there are no eligible submissions or Eligible Individuals (as defined below), or if Eligible Individuals do not successfully complete the compliance and tax obligations set forth below.

## Award guidelines

Award amounts are determined based on submission components (ex: does the submission have an accompanying video tutorial?), quality (ex: are the submission‚Äôs code and accompanying written tutorial well-written and understandable?), and accessibility (ex: are all components of the submission public?). 

Here is a breakdown of all content component options:  

- Required: $400 worth of XLM for contract (dapp) code and a live (usable), interactive demo
- Optional: Add on $150 worth of XLM if your submission includes well-documented code and a detailed README on how to build and run your dapp on Soroban
- Optional: Add on $250 worth of XLM if your submission includes a tutorial on how to build your dapp on Soroban published on dev.to or Medium 
- Optional: Add on $500 worth of XLM if your submission includes a video tutorial on building and running your dapp with Soroban published on YouTube

Submissions must contain contract (dapp) code and a demo but award amounts can be increased by including any or all of the additional content components. 

Submission examples are:

1) contract (dapp) code and a demo ($400 worth of XLM) plus a published video tutorial ($500 worth of XLM) for a total of $900 worth of XLM; 
2) contract (dapp) code and a demo ($400 worth of XLM) plus a decent README, ($150 worth of XLM), and a published written tutorial ($250 worth of XLM) for a total of $800 worth of XLM. 

A submission is eligible to be awarded up to $1,300 if it contains all the above components.

## Example dapp resources

To help you get started, here are some example dapp resources that you can use as references:

- [The Soroban Dapps Challenge](https://soroban.stellar.org/dapps/): Complete dapp development milestones, resulting in a smart contract and UI/UX templates for future projects, along with an MVP to build upon. It offers developers practical experience and valuable resources to excel in your journey.
- [Scaffold Soroban](https://github.com/stellar/scaffold-soroban): Take advantage of the examples, like soroban-react-payment and soroban-react-mint-token, to create robust dapps on Soroban, all while leveraging our powerful JavaScript SDKs.

## Get Started

If you haven't already, check out the [Soroban docs](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs) to get oriented, get set up, and get your head around the Soroban fundamentals. When you're ready to create a submission:

1. Click the "Discussions" tab at the top of the page
2. Create a "New Discussion"
3. Title your discussion thread
4. Select the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù category
5. Github Discussions requires you to search for similar discussion threads before creating a new thread.  It's a good idea!  That way, you can see submissions that have already been turned in.  Don't copy from any, but feel free to create something similar.
6. When you're ready, check off ‚ÄúI have done a search for similar discussions.‚Äù
7. Add your submission.  Feel free to put it right in the box, or to link to an external resource.
8. Your submission should then be posted on the Discussions page

We will review your submission within three weeks (this is subject to be longer depending on the holidays) and reply on your submission thread to let you know if your submission qualifies to receive an award! If so, we will ask you to complete a form to collect the info necessary to validate and deliver an award.

If your submission did not qualify, we may provide you with feedback on what's missing or on how you can improve your submission so it qualifies. Once you have made the requested revisions, we will re-review your submission and let you know if your submission qualifies for an award.
